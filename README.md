# Mountie-Mobile-Website

This is the Mountie Mobile Website, designed by Jack Norris. It's a little ghetto, but hey, it's not really client
facing (it's for the adminstrators). With this website, you can submit events and announcements for approval from 
the school and have them appear on the Mountie Mobile App
